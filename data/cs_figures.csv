Charles Babbage,1791,"mathematician, philosopher, inventor, mechanical engineer",Invented the first mechanical computer,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Charles_Babbage_-_1860.jpg/458px-Charles_Babbage_-_1860.jpg,"Considered by some to be a father of the computer, Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that eventually led to more complex designs. His varied work in other fields has led him to be described as pre-eminent among the many polymaths of his century"
Ada Lovelace,1815,"mathematician, writer",First computer programmer,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Ada_Lovelace_portrait.jpg/417px-Ada_Lovelace_portrait.jpg," known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer"
George Boole,1815," mathematician, educator, philosopher and logician",Invented boolean algebra,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/George_Boole_color.jpg,
Alan Turing,1912,"computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, theoretical biologist",father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Alan_Turing_Aged_16.jpg/461px-Alan_Turing_Aged_16.jpg,"He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer"
Grace Hopper,1902,computer scientist ,invented the first compiler for a computer programming language,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Commodore_Grace_M._Hopper%2C_USN_%28covered%29.jpg/480px-Commodore_Grace_M._Hopper%2C_USN_%28covered%29.jpg,"In 1944, she was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer [2] and invented the first compiler for a computer programming language.[3][4][5][6][7] She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, one of the first high-level programming languages. She also popularized use of the term bug (already established in other technical contexts) in reference to computer software or hardware design failures."
Konrad Zuse,1910,"civil engineer, inventor",created the first programmable computer;,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Konrad_Zuse_%281992%29.jpg,"His greatest achievement was the world's first programmable computer; the functional program-controlled Turing-complete Z3 became operational in May 1941. Thanks to this machine and its predecessors, Zuse has often been regarded as the inventor of the modern computer."
Douglas Engelbart,1925,"engineer, inventor","created of the computer mouse, the development of hypertext, networked computers, and precursors to graphical user interfaces",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Douglas_Engelbart_in_2008.jpg/486px-Douglas_Engelbart_in_2008.jpg,"In the early 1950s, he decided that instead of ""having a steady job"" – such as his position at NASA's Ames Research Center – he would focus on making the world a better place. He reasoned that because the complexity of the world's problems were increasing, and that any effort to improve the world would require the coordination of groups of people, the most effective way to solve problems was to augment human intelligence and develop ways of building collective intelligence.[6] He believed that the computer, which was at the time thought of only as a tool for automation, would be an essential tool for future knowledge workers to solve such problems. He was a committed, vocal proponent of the development and use of computers and computer networks to help cope with the world’s increasingly urgent and complex problems. Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab, which he termed ""bootstrapping"". His belief was that when human systems and tool systems were aligned, such that workers spent time ""improving their tools for improving their tools"" it would lead to an accelerating rate of progress."
